# Palladio-Supporting-FeatureModel
As part of the Palladio project a feature model () has been developed and provided as an EMF / eCore based implementation. The feature model and the editors are not limited to be used within the Palladio tooling, but can be integrated in other applications or used as a standalone modeling tool as well. 

The feature model decides between the feature model itself and the feature configuration. The former describes the complete feature space while the later describes a specific configuration of the former.

At the current state, the editor is located in the sources of the core palladio system.
